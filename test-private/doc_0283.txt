When	WRB
performative	JJ
utterances	NNS
are	VBP
explicit	JJ
,	,
then	RB
they	PRP
are	VBP
usually	RB
in	IN
the	DT
first	JJ
person	NN
present	JJ
tense	NN
.	.

While	IN
some	DT
linguists	NNS
and	CC
theorists	NNS
might	MD
describe	VB
explicit	JJ
performative	JJ
utterances	NNS
as	IN
rare	JJ
occurrences	NNS
,	,
Eve	NNP
Sedgwick	NNP
argues	VBZ
that	IN
there	EX
are	VBP
performative	JJ
aspects	NNS
to	TO
nearly	RB
all	DT
words	NNS
,	,
sentences	NNS
,	,
and	CC
phrases	NNS
.	.

These	DT
categories	NNS
are	VBP
not	RB
exclusive	JJ
,	,
so	RB
an	DT
utterance	NN
may	MD
well	RB
have	VB
both	DT
qualities	NNS

As	IN
Sedgwick	NNP
observes	VBZ
,	,
performative	JJ
utterances	NNS
can	MD
be	VB
revoked	VBN

either	RB
by	IN
the	DT
person	NN

them	PRP
(	-LRB-
"	``

,	,
or	CC
by	IN
some	DT
other	JJ

not	RB
immediately	RB
