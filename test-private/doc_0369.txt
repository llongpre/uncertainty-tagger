Statistics	NNS

market	NN

show	VBP
that	IN
the	DT

not	RB

important	JJ
to	IN

neither	RB

the	DT

Another	DT

supported	VBN

that	WDT

The	DT
most	RBS

that	IN

the	DT

What	WP
is	VBZ
accepted	VBN
as	IN
"	``
masculine	JJ
"	''
has	VBZ
shifted	VBN
considerably	RB
throughout	IN
the	DT

so	IN
the	DT
modern	JJ
concept	NN

how	WRB
a	DT

be	VB
"	``
differs	NNS
from	IN
the	DT
ideal	JJ
man	NN
of	IN
previous	JJ

Some	DT
styles	NNS

behaviors	NNS
that	WDT

today	NN

in	IN

knee	NN

Hence	RB

as	IN
the	DT
concept	NN

'	``
femininity	NN

conquered	VBD

masculinity	NN

Perhaps	RB
metrosexuality	NN

a	DT
reaction	NN

this	DT

as	IN
some	DT

It	PRP
