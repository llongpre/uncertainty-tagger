Employing	VBG
his	PRP$
customary	JJ
method	NN

attack	NN

the	DT
reductio	NN

Zeno	NNP
has	VBZ
argued	VBN
that	IN
if	IN
as	IN
the	DT
pluralists	NNS
say	VBP
things	NNS
are	VBP
many	JJ
,	,
then	RB
they	PRP
will	MD
be	VB
both	CC

but	CC
this	DT

an	DT
impossible	JJ
situation	NN
,	,
for	IN
unlike	JJ
things	NNS
can	MD
not	RB
be	VB

But	CC
this	DT
difficulty	NN

says	VBZ
Socrates	NNPS

if	IN
we	PRP

prepared	JJ

the	DT
distinction	NN

on	IN

Thus	RB
one	CD

the	DT
same	JJ
thing	NN
can	MD
be	VB
both	DT

or	CC
one	CD

many	JJ

by	IN
participating	VBG

Unity	NNP

I	PRP

as	IN
such	JJ
partake	NN

the	DT

Unity	NNP

but	CC
I	PRP
also	RB
have	VBP
many	JJ

in	IN

I	PRP

There	EX
