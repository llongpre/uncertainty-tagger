The	DT

Some	DT
degree	NN
of	IN

can	MD
also	RB
be	VB
traced	VBN
back	RB
to	IN
Greece	NNP

where	WRB
a	DT

could	MD
be	VB

to	TO

Early	RB
stays	NNS
,	,
as	IN
used	VBN
in	IN
the	DT
seventeenth	JJ
century	NN
did	VBD
not	RB
involve	VB
the	DT
bodice	NN
directly	RB

concentrated	VBD
on	IN
constricting	VBG
the	DT
waist	NN

indirectly	RB
thrusting	VBG
up	RP
the	DT
upper	JJ
body	NN

With	IN
time	NN
the	DT

came	VBD

These	DT

The	DT

The	DT

It	PRP

that	IN

they	PRP
still	RB
