Covering	NN

the	DT

may	MD
date	NN
back	RB
to	IN
ancient	JJ
Greece	NNP

This	DT
belief	NN
is	VBZ
based	VBN
on	IN
wall	NN
paintings	NNS
in	IN
Crete	NNP
,	,
the	DT
centre	NN
of	IN
the	DT
Minoan	NNP
civilisation	NN

which	WDT
show	VBP
what	WP
has	VBZ
been	VBN
described	VBN
as	IN
a	DT
'	``

These	DT
appear	VBP
to	TO
be	VB
women	NNS
performing	VBG

Similar	JJ
depictions	NNS
are	VBP
seen	VBN
in	IN

(	-LRB-

However	RB
Minoan	NNP
women	NNS
on	IN
the	DT
island	NN
of	IN
Crete	NNP
3,000	CD
years	NNS
ago	RB
wore	VBD
garments	NNS
that	WDT
partially	RB
supported	VBD
yet	RB
revealed	VBN
their	PRP$
bare	JJ

The	DT
best	RBS
known	JJ
example	NN
of	IN
this	DT
being	VBG
the	DT
Snake	NNP
Goddess	NNP

They	PRP
used	VBD
corsets	NNS
that	WDT
were	VBD
fitted	VBN

that	WDT
left	VBD
the	DT

or	CC
even	RB
forced	VBD
them	PRP

them	PRP
more	RBR

However	RB
this	DT
'	``
corset	NN

was	VBD
outerwear	NN

not	RB

Therefore	RB
it	PRP
would	MD
be	VB
a	DT
mistake	NN
to	TO
believe	VB
that	IN

a	DT

was	VBD
a	DT

The	DT

the	DT

a	DT
