Meteorologists	NNS
worldwide	RB
have	VBP
for	IN
a	DT
long	JJ
time	NN
measured	VBN
atmospheric	JJ
pressure	NN
in	IN
millibars	NNS
.	.

After	IN
the	DT
introduction	NN
of	IN
SI	NNP
units	NNS
,	,
many	JJ
preferred	VBN
to	TO
preserve	VB
the	DT
customary	JJ
pressure	NN
figures	NNS
.	.

Therefore	RB
,	,
meteorologists	NNS
use	VBP
hectopascals	NNS
(	-LRB-
hPa	NNP

today	NN
for	IN
air	NN
pressure	NN
,	,
which	WDT
are	VBP
equivalent	JJ
to	IN
millibars	NNS

while	IN
similar	JJ
pressures	NNS
are	VBP
given	VBN
in	IN
kilopascals	NNS
in	IN
practically	RB
all	DT
other	JJ
fields	NNS

the	DT

hardly	RB

Since	IN
official	JJ
metrication	NN

meteorologists	NNS
in	IN
Canada	NNP
use	VBP
kilopascals	NNS
(	-LRB-
kPa	NNP
