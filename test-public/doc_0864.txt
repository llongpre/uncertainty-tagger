The	DT

Portevinâ€“Le	NNP
Chatelier	NNP
effect	NN
'	''
describes	VBZ
a	DT
serrated	JJ
stress	NN

strain	NN
curve	NN
,	,
which	WDT
some	DT
materiels	NNS
exhibit	NN
as	IN
they	PRP
undergo	VBP
plastic	JJ
deformation	NN
.	.

This	DT
effect	NN
occurs	VBZ
,	,
when	WRB
solute	JJ
atoms	NNS
(	-LRB-
e.g	$
C	NN
in	IN
steels	NNS
)	-RRB-
have	VBP
sufficient	JJ
mobility	NN
and	CC
thus	RB
can	MD
segregate	VB
at	IN
a	DT
dislocation	NN
core	NN

When	WRB
a	DT
freed	VBN
dislocation	NN
runs	VBZ
through	IN
thr	PRP$
crystal	NN
it	PRP
disturbs	VBZ
other	JJ
locked	JJ
dislocations	NNS
,	,
and	CC
may	MD
cause	VB
an	DT

like	JJ
freeing	NN
of	IN

Since	IN
this	DT
process	NN
can	MD
happen	VB
several	JJ
times	NNS

it	PRP
leads	VBZ
to	IN
serrations	NNS
in	IN
the	DT

Due	IN

some	DT

magnesium	NN
alloys	NNS

during	IN
