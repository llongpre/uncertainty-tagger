This	DT
is	VBZ
known	VBN
as	IN
salting	JJ
.	.

Since	IN
the	DT
salt	NN
is	VBZ
usually	RB
different	JJ
for	IN
each	DT
user	NN
,	,
the	DT
attacker	NN
can	MD
no	RB
longer	RB
construct	VB
tables	NNS
with	IN
a	DT
single	JJ
encrypted	VBN
version	NN
of	IN
each	DT
candidate	NN
password	NN
.	.

Attackers	NNS
could	MD
still	RB
build	VB
tables	NNS
with	IN
common	JJ
passwords	NNS
encrypted	VBD
with	IN
all	DT
4096	CD
possible	JJ
12-bit	NN
salts	NNS
.	.

However	RB
,	,
if	IN
the	DT
salt	NN
is	VBZ
long	RB
enough	RB
,	,
there	EX
are	VBP
too	RB
many	JJ
possibilities	NNS
and	CC
the	DT
attacker	NN
must	MD
repeat	VB
the	DT
encryption	NN
of	IN
every	DT
guess	NN
for	IN
each	DT
user	NN
.	.
