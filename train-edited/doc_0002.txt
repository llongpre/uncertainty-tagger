The	DT	O
protection	NN	O
of	IN	O
photographs	NNS	O
in	IN	O
this	DT	O
manner	NN	O
has	VBZ	O
been	VBN	O
criticised	VBN	O
on	IN	O
two	CD	O
grounds	NNS	O
.	.	O

Firstly	RB	O
,	,	O
it	PRP	O
is	VBZ	O
argued	VBN	O
that	IN	O
photographs	NNS	O
should	MD	O
not	RB	O
be	VB	O
protected	VBN	O
as	IN	O
artistic	JJ	O
works	NNS	O
,	,	O
but	CC	O
should	MD	O
instead	RB	O
be	VB	O
protected	VBN	O
in	IN	O
a	DT	O
manner	NN	O
similar	JJ	O
to	IN	O
that	DT	O
of	IN	O
sound	JJ	O
recordings	NNS	O
and	CC	O
films	NNS	O
.	.	O

In	IN	O
other	JJ	O
words	NNS	O
,	,	O
copyright	NN	O
should	MD	O
not	RB	O
protect	VB	O
the	DT	O
subject	JJ	O
matter	NN	O
of	IN	O
a	DT	O
photograph	NN	O
as	IN	O
a	DT	O
matter	NN	O
of	RB	O
course	RB	O
as	IN	O
a	DT	O
consequence	NN	O
of	IN	O
a	DT	O
photograph	NN	O
being	VBG	O
taken	VBN	O
.	.	O

It	PRP	B
is	VBZ	I
argued	VBN	I
that	IN	O
protection	NN	O
of	IN	O
photographs	NNS	O
as	IN	O
artistic	JJ	O
works	NNS	O
is	VBZ	O
anomalous	JJ	O
,	,	O
in	IN	O
that	DT	O
photography	NN	O
is	VBZ	O
ultimately	RB	O
a	DT	O
medium	NN	O
of	IN	O
reproduction	NN	O
,	,	O
rather	RB	O
than	IN	O
creation	NN	O
.	.	O

For	IN	O
example	NN	O
,	,	O
Michael	NNP	O
Reichmann	NNP	O
describes	VBZ	O
photography	NN	O
as	IN	O
an	DT	O
art	NN	O
of	IN	O
disclosure	NN	O
,	,	O
as	IN	O
opposed	VBN	O
to	IN	O
an	DT	O
art	NN	O
of	IN	O
inclusion	NN	O
.	.	O

Secondly	RB	O
,	,	O
it	PRP	B
is	VBZ	I
argued	VBN	I
that	IN	O
the	DT	O
protection	NN	O
of	IN	O
photographs	NNS	O
as	IN	O
artistic	JJ	O
works	NNS	O
leads	VBZ	O
to	IN	O
bizarre	JJ	O
results	NNS	O
.	.	O

For	IN	O
example	NN	O
,	,	O
it	PRP	B
is	VBZ	I
possible	JJ	I
that	IN	O
Vogue	NNP	O
Magazine	NNP	O
would	MD	O
be	VB	O
infringing	VBG	O
copyright	NN	O
if	IN	O
they	PRP	O
,	,	O
inspired	VBN	O
by	IN	O
a	DT	O
picture	NN	O
taken	VBN	O
by	IN	O
a	DT	O
drunk	JJ	O
boyfriend	NN	O
of	IN	O
his	PRP$	O
girlfriend	NN	O
posing	VBG	O
provocatively	RB	O
on	IN	O
a	DT	O
motorcycle	NN	O
,	,	O
attempted	VBD	O
to	TO	O
recreate	VB	O
the	DT	O
photograph	NN	O
.	.	O

Similarly	RB	O
,	,	O
it	PRP	B
is	VBZ	I
possible	JJ	I
that	IN	O
a	DT	O
famous	JJ	O
wildlife	NN	O
photographer	NN	O
,	,	O
inspired	VBN	O
by	IN	O
a	DT	O
cheap	JJ	O
snapshot	NN	O
of	IN	O
cheetah	NN	O
at	IN	O
the	DT	O
zoo	NN	O
,	,	O
on	IN	O
Flikr	NNP	O
,	,	O
would	MD	O
be	VB	O
infringing	VBG	O
copyright	NN	O
if	IN	O
he	PRP	O
went	VBD	O
exploring	VBG	O
the	DT	O
Okovango	NNP	O
Delta	NNP	O
in	IN	O
search	NN	O
of	IN	O
a	DT	O
cheetah	NN	O
in	IN	O
a	DT	O
similar	JJ	O
pose	NN	O
.	.	O

That	DT	O
said	VBD	O
,	,	O
it	PRP	B
is	VBZ	I
possible	JJ	I
that	IN	O
the	DT	O
threshold	NN	O
of	IN	O
originality	NN	O
is	VBZ	O
very	RB	O
low	JJ	O
.	.	O

For	IN	O
example	NN	O
,	,	O
in	IN	O
Walter	NNP	O
v	IN	O
Lane	NNP	O
,	,	O
reporters	NNS	O
who	WP	O
transcribed	VBD	O
a	DT	O
speech	NN	O
were	VBD	B
held	VBN	I
to	TO	O
be	VB	O
authors	NNS	O
of	IN	O
the	DT	O
transcription	NN	O
,	,	O
and	CC	O
owners	NNS	O
of	IN	O
a	DT	O
copyright	NN	O
which	WDT	O
subsisted	VBD	O
in	IN	O
it	PRP	O
.	.	O

Essentially	RB	O
,	,	O
by	IN	O
this	DT	O
,	,	O
Arnold	NNP	O
is	VBZ	O
arguing	VBG	O
that	IN	O
whilst	IN	O
the	DT	O
subject	JJ	O

of	IN	O
some	DT	O
photographs	NNS	O
may	MD	O
deserve	VB	O
protection	NN	O
,	,	O
it	PRP	O
is	VBZ	O
inappropriate	JJ	O
for	IN	O
the	DT	O
law	NN	O
the	DT	O
presume	NN	O
that	IN	O
the	DT	O
subject	JJ	O

of	IN	O
all	DT	O

is	VBZ	O
deserving	VBG	O
