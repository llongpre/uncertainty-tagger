two	CD	_
grounds	NNS	_
.	.	_

Firstly	RB	_
,	,	_
it	PRP	_
is	VBZ	_
argued	VBN	_
that	IN	_
photographs	NNS	_
should	MD	_
not	RB	_
be	VB	_
protected	VBN	_
as	IN	_
artistic	JJ	_
works	NNS	_
,	,	_
but	CC	_
should	MD	_
instead	RB	_
be	VB	_
protected	VBN	_
in	IN	_
a	DT	_
manner	NN	_
similar	JJ	_
to	IN	_
that	DT	_
of	IN	_
sound	JJ	_

and	CC	_
films	NNS	_
.	.	_

In	IN	_
other	JJ	_
words	NNS	_
,	,	_
copyright	NN	_
should	MD	_
not	RB	_
protect	VB	_
the	DT	_
subject	JJ	_
matter	NN	_
of	IN	_
a	DT	_
photograph	NN	_
as	IN	_
a	DT	_
matter	NN	_
of	RB	_
course	RB	_
as	IN	_
a	DT	_
consequence	NN	_
of	IN	_
a	DT	_
photograph	NN	_
being	VBG	_
taken	VBN	_
.	.	_

It	PRP	CUE-1
is	VBZ	CUE-1
argued	VBN	CUE-1
that	IN	_
protection	NN	_
of	IN	_
photographs	NNS	_
as	IN	_
artistic	JJ	_
works	NNS	_
is	VBZ	_
anomalous	JJ	_
,	,	_
in	IN	_
that	DT	_
photography	NN	_
is	VBZ	_
ultimately	RB	_
a	DT	_
medium	NN	_
of	IN	_
reproduction	NN	_
,	,	_
rather	RB	_
than	IN	_
creation	NN	_
.	.	_

For	IN	_
example	NN	_
,	,	_
Michael	NNP	_
Reichmann	NNP	_
describes	VBZ	_
photography	NN	_
as	IN	_
an	DT	_
art	NN	_
of	IN	_
disclosure	NN	_
,	,	_
as	IN	_
opposed	VBN	_
to	IN	_
an	DT	_
art	NN	_
of	IN	_
inclusion	NN	_
.	.	_

Secondly	RB	_
,	,	_
it	PRP	CUE-1
is	VBZ	CUE-1
argued	VBN	CUE-1
that	IN	_
the	DT	_
protection	NN	_
of	IN	_
photographs	NNS	_
as	IN	_
artistic	JJ	_
works	NNS	_
leads	VBZ	_
to	IN	_
bizarre	JJ	_
results	NNS	_
.	.	_

For	IN	_
example	NN	_
,	,	_
it	PRP	CUE-1
is	VBZ	CUE-1
possible	JJ	CUE-1
that	IN	_
Vogue	NNP	_
Magazine	NNP	_
would	MD	_
be	VB	_
infringing	VBG	_
copyright	NN	_
if	IN	_
they	PRP	_
,	,	_
inspired	VBN	_
by	IN	_
a	DT	_
picture	NN	_
taken	VBN	_
by	IN	_
a	DT	_
drunk	JJ	_
boyfriend	NN	_
of	IN	_
his	PRP$	_
girlfriend	NN	_
posing	VBG	_
provocatively	RB	_
on	IN	_
a	DT	_
motorcycle	NN	_
,	,	_
attempted	VBD	_
to	TO	_
recreate	VB	_
the	DT	_
photograph	NN	_
.	.	_

Similarly	RB	_
,	,	_
it	PRP	CUE-1
is	VBZ	CUE-1
possible	JJ	CUE-1
that	IN	_
a	DT	_
famous	JJ	_
wildlife	NN	_
photographer	NN	_
,	,	_
inspired	VBN	_
by	IN	_
a	DT	_
cheap	JJ	_
snapshot	NN	_
of	IN	_
cheetah	NN	_
at	IN	_
the	DT	_
zoo	NN	_
,	,	_
on	IN	_
Flikr	NNP	_
,	,	_
would	MD	_
be	VB	_
infringing	VBG	_
copyright	NN	_
if	IN	_
he	PRP	_
went	VBD	_
exploring	VBG	_
the	DT	_
Okovango	NNP	_
Delta	NNP	_
in	IN	_
search	NN	_
of	IN	_
a	DT	_
cheetah	NN	_
in	IN	_
a	DT	_
similar	JJ	_
pose	NN	_
.	.	_

That	DT	_
said	VBD	_
,	,	_
it	PRP	CUE-1
is	VBZ	CUE-1
possible	JJ	CUE-1
that	IN	_
the	DT	_
threshold	NN	_
of	IN	_
originality	NN	_
is	VBZ	_
very	RB	_
low	JJ	_
.	.	_

For	IN	_
example	NN	_
,	,	_
in	IN	_
Walter	NNP	_
v	IN	_
Lane	NNP	_
,	,	_
reporters	NNS	_
who	WP	_
transcribed	VBD	_
a	DT	_

were	VBD	CUE-1
held	VBN	CUE-1
to	TO	_
be	VB	_
authors	NNS	_
of	IN	_
the	DT	_
transcription	NN	_
,	,	_
and	CC	_
owners	NNS	_
of	IN	_
a	DT	_
copyright	NN	_
which	WDT	_
subsisted	VBD	_
in	IN	_
it	PRP	_

Essentially	RB	_
,	,	_
by	IN	_
this	DT	_
,	,	_
Arnold	NNP	_
is	VBZ	_
arguing	VBG	_
that	IN	_
whilst	IN	_
the	DT	_

some	DT	_

,	,	_
it	PRP	_
is	VBZ	_
inappropriate	JJ	_
for	IN	_
the	DT	_

the	DT	_
presume	NN	_
that	IN	_
the	DT	_
